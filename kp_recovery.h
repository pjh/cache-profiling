 * Defines a "flush" operation that explicitly flushes data from all cache
 * levels of all processor cores. This operation requires x86 instructions
 * that were added with Intel's SSE2 extensions, which were first used in
 * Pentium 4 processors, so modern processors should support them.
 *
 * Inspired by "Consistent and Durable Data Structures for Non-Volatile
 * Byte-Addressable Memory" paper:
